# Fire Detection Using YOLOv8 🔥

## Overview
This project is a real-time fire detection system leveraging **YOLOv8**, **OpenCV**, and **PyTorch**. The model detects fire in images and videos, helping in early fire detection and prevention. 

## Key Features ✅
- Detects fire in images and videos 🔥
- Uses YOLOv8 for object detection 🖼️
- Runs efficiently on GPU (CUDA) for faster inference ⚡
- Can be deployed for real-time fire monitoring 🚒

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **YOLOv8**  
- **PyTorch**  
- **OpenCV**  
- **CUDA (for GPU acceleration, optional)**  

## Installation & Setup ⚙️
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fire-detection.git
   cd fire-detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy torch torchvision torchaudio
   ```
3. Run the detection script:  
   ```bash
